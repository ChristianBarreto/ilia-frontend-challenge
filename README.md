## 4. Project strategy
I'm delivering all requirements mentioned on the test Repo and email. As part of my strategy I decided to focus on the main functionalities and delivery a sample of usage of the side requirements.

While installing i18-next for internationalization I faced issues with TypeScript version of the dependencies not having available time to properlly fix it, so I was forced to use Yarn as package managment, so NPM may not work.

If you search for the word "NOTE", you will find few comments that I did to explain why made some decisions.

## 5. Design patterns
I applied the Atomic design pattern to define the directory structure as far as this pattern matches with the atomicity React concept.

I also applied wildly the immutability concept to handle React states and context.

## 6. My contact
Please, feel free to discuss with me all the details about this project and why I took determined decisions.
